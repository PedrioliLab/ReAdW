ReAdW
=====

## Description
Convert ThermoFinningan RAW mass spectrometry files to the mzXML format[1].

## Dependencies
ReAdW requires either Xcalibur or MSFileReader to be installed or minimally just the three DLLs: XRawfile2.dll, fileio.dll, fregistry.dll.
Here's the link to download Thermo's freely available [MSFileReader](http://sjsupport.thermofinnigan.com/public/detail.asp?id=703).

## Binaries
Two binaries are available depending on which dependency is installed on your system:
- The MSFileReader compatible is [here](https://github.com/PedrioliLab/ReAdW/blob/master/bin/ReAdW.201411.msfilereader.exe)
- The Xcalibur compatible one is [here](https://github.com/PedrioliLab/ReAdW/blob/master/bin/ReAdW.201411.xcalibur.exe)

## Compilation
ReAdW can be compiled from source using Visual Studio 2010.

## Latest changes
